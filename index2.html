  <p><b>Riker Ipsum</b><br>
You’re going to be an interesting companion, Mr. Data. Talk about going nowhere fast. Wouldn’t that bring about chaos? I am your worst nightmare! Congratulations - you just destroyed the Enterprise. You enjoyed that. Did you come here for something in particular or just general Riker-bashing? A lot of things can change in twelve years, Admiral. I think you’ve let your personal feelings cloud your judgement. Now we know what they mean by 'advanced’ tactical training. Earl Grey tea, watercress sandwiches… and Bularian canapés? Are you up for promotion? Besides, you look good in a dress. Smooth as an android’s bottom, eh, Data?

  <p><b>Whedon Ipsum</b><br>
 It eats you, starting with your bottom. Don’t care much for fancy parties. And you know the monkey’s just,‘I mock you with my monkey pants!’ This may come as a shock, but I’m actually not very good at talking to girls. Wash, we’ve got some local color happening. We don’t have wings, we just skate around with perfect hair fighting crime. Scenario: We raise Buffy from the grave. She tries to eat our brains. In my world, we have people in chains, and we can ride them like ponies. The news isn’t there to tell you what happened. It’s there to tell you what it wants you to hear or what it thinks you want to hear. That girl will rain destruction down on you and your ship.

<p class=head>OTHER NOTES</p>

  <p><b>Doctor Ipsum</b><br>
Time travel is like visiting Paris. You can’t just read the guidebook, you’ve got to throw yourself in! Eat the food, use the wrong verbs, get charged double and end up kissing complete strangers! Or is that just me? I don’t want to go. There’s something that doesn’t make sense. Let’s go and poke it with a stick. It’s the city of New New York! Strictly speaking, it’s the fifteenth New York since the original, so that makes it New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New New York.

  <p><b>MMO Ipsum</b><br>
As my hunter slowly picks her way through the Mines of Moria, I decided it was about time to get my alt on and roll up another character. Orcs, trolls, undead, cattle, space squid goats with gazelle legs - are you kidding me? How do heroics feel as a whole? Most likely this means that you received a fraudulent code from a third-party seller. This is also why we’re allowing players to rent their own servers and create their own private worlds with their own rules. We should just accept the fact that the game will quickly disappoint us and we will look to Blizzard to save us once again.
